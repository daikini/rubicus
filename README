Rubicus is a pure Ruby wrapper around the ploticus http://ploticus.sourceforge.net graphing library.

For basic usage instructions, refer to the documentation for Rubicus::Graph.

Based on the design of Scruffy Graphs (a beautiful graphing library for Ruby) by Brasten Sager. http://scruffy.rubyforge.org/
Custom ploticus graph code taken from ploticus.rb by Mike Neumann. http://www.ntecs.de/blog-old/Blog/RubyPloticus.rdoc
